/* This function operates under the assumption that the number of first round series/matches is accurate.

 * lowest (1) to highest.
 * The processing proceeds round by round, looping through the matches in that round. If there is no match
 * with the match number that it expects (matchNum variable) then it fills in an empty matchup in that slot.
