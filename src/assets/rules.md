# RD2L Rules {title}

1. **Eligibility**
   - **Participants**
       - Skater is banned.
       - This is a player draft league. We only accept individual sign-ups, no team sign-ups.
       - All participants will be vouched by a division admin.
       - Participants must sign up with their main account. This account may not be used by any other player for the duration of the season.
         - Participants are required to use the steam account provided at the time of sign-ups when playing any RD2L game.
       - Participants must alert the admins if their rank does not accurately reflect their skill level, or if they have alternate accounts they regularly use.
         - Admins may adjust a player's rank to be more accurate in these situations.
       - Players must sign-up on the current Steam account they primarily use for playing Dota, except in the case described in the next rule. The required 500 games and 250 wins on the account must all have been played by the player who is signing up.
       - Before registering, players are required to turn "Expose Public Match Data" on in the Dota 2 client > Settings > Options > Profile.
         - Players are not required to keep match data public for the remainder of the season, only for the draft.
       - No one should expect to miss more than 2 weeks in the season (including playoffs).
         - If a participant expects inconsistent attendance for an upcoming season, they are encouraged to instead sign up as a stand-in or free agent, as appropriate.
       - Admins will be watching for accounts that have unusual match history. Those accounts may be removed from the league at the time they are discovered at the discretion of the admins. Since there are various ways this rule can be violated, any other punishment will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
       - Every player on a team’s roster must play in at least 1 game of the bo2 each week, if available, and each player on the roster must play one game for a minimum of five weeks over the course of the season.
         - This rule is extended into the post season. Every player on a team’s roster must play at least 1 game of the bo3, if available.
       - Participants may only play in 1 sub-division in a season of RD2L. This means a player cannot sign up for multiple sub-divisions or the same division using multiple identities.
   - **Captains**
     - Captains are also participants and all participant rules apply to captains.
     - Captains should have completed at least one previous season before signing up as a captain, unless they get permission from an admin.
       - Due to our format of drafting players on to teams, participants who have not played in the league before may find captaining challenging, if you have good prior experience exceptions to this rule can be made by contacting an admin.
     - Captains will be responsible for drafting their RD2L team and organizing their teams.
     - Captains will be responsible for turning in the results of each regular season and playoff match by 9pm of the day after their match if the match is not ticketed.
     - The captain will be the primary contact for their team, this includes communication with other teams as well as RD2L admins.
     - Captains do not have the power to remove players from their team after the draft.
     - Captains should be at least Legend[1] rank or higher. This threshold may be increased or decreased at the discretion of division admins.
   - **Stand-ins**
     - When a team is missing a player and requires a stand-in, they must formally request one in their divisions stand-in channel in discord, listing the dotabuff of their missing player and the dotabuff of the player they would like to use as a stand-in, they must @ their division admin and opposing captain for that week as well.
     - If a team is missing one of their players, the team is eligible to use a stand-in for this player.
       - The standin must have been the same badge or lower on the draft sheet (according to adjusted mmr for players that were adjusted) and must not have climbed above the player they are replacing.
       - The standin must be an RD2L player. The division admin and opposing captain must be notified of who you are missing and who you are using as a stand-in before the match begins.
     - Teams may use 2 stand-ins per match, for a maximum of 8 games during a season. Using two standins in one match counts as two standin uses, so using two standins four times will use the entirety of a teams standin usages. If a team finds itself needing more than this, they should contact a division admin with regards to a free agent.
       - Stand-in usage from the season will be reset for all playoff teams. Playoff teams may use a stand-in for a maximum of two series of the playoffs. (Series means all games of a round, usually best of 3 or best of 5)
       - If a team is forced to use a standin because admins have not found a free agent for the team yet, these standin uses will not count towards the team total
     - If a team needs three stand-ins in order to play they must forfeit the match.
     - If a captain believes a stand-in is not fair they can report it to their division admin to decide if the stand-in can be used or not. (Basically there will be admin discretion for stand-ins).
     - If an admin discovers that a player used an unauthorized stand-in after the matches have been completed, the admin may retroactively call a forfeit for any games the unauthorized player played in. This will be decided on a case by case basis.
   - **Free Agents**
     - Free Agents are players that are eligible to be permanently added to teams during the season. If a captain requests a free agent, an admin will assign one to you after verifying that the free agent still wishes to participate in RD2L.
     - If a captain would like a free-agent, they must prove that they have an inactive player or a player disrupting team environment. After this is done, the inactive player is removed from the team in all forms.
     - Free agents may be assigned by the admins with the following priority (assuming Rank is similar to the player being replaced):
       - Players left over from the draft/signed up as free agents prior to the season.
       - Players from disbanded teams that were not the cause of the disband.
       - Players that signed up as free agents during the season.
     - When the admin assigns a new free-agent to the team, this free-agent cannot be rejected.
     - The free agent will either be a close match or a player with lower rank (as close as possible), depending on the availability of free-agents.
     - Free agents cannot be assigned until the end of scim week (Week 0) to ensure that teams are fully utilizing the players they drafted.
     - Free agents will not be assigned after the default time for Week 8 games of the division of the team that asked for a free agent.
2. **Format**
   - **Divisions**
     - Divisions are determined every season by the RD2L admins based on activity level for each division in previous seasons. If existing divisions grow large enough, expansion to additional days will be considered.
     - Divisions will consist of a time zone and Dota 2 server combination (example: EST and USE) as well as a night of the week (example: Thursday). All matches for that division will be played on that server, on that night of the week, and the default times will be specific to that time zone.
     - Divisions will have as many teams as the number of captains assign to that division and as few teams as the number of players signed up to fill out those teams. (Number of Players)/(5) ≤ (Number of Teams) ≤ (Number of Captains). Divisions will consist of at least 6 teams.
     - Each division will have its own admin. This admin will be the first point of contact for captains and players in the division. They will also be responsible for helping run the draft, calling forfeits, approving stand-ins, assigning free agents and checking results.
   - **Draft**
     - There will be 1 draft per sub-division.
     - The player pool of the draft will consist of the first (4x total number of captains) players who registered for that division.
     - The draft type (e.g., snake, linear, etc.) will be determined by the division admins.
     - Pick order is selected based on the captain’s rank. (Roughly, captains lower badges will be earlier in the pick order.)
     - The draft will consist of 5 rounds as needed to fill out teams.
     - Undrafted players will go into the free agent pool.
   - **Games**
     - All games are to be played on the division server and in Captains Mode, hosted by one of the captains or an admin on the RD2L ticket.
       - If for whatever reason a match cannot begin before the default time and it is determined by an admin that it was due to no fault of the teams (e.g. Dota 2 network is down, there is a large Dota 2 update, etc.), then the admin may, in the event that the issue will end shortly, give the teams an extension.
     - Penalties for tardiness are as follows, and may be enforced by the opposing captain as they see fit:
       - 5 minutes past start time - Level 1 draft penalty.
       - 10 minutes past start time - Level 2 draft penalty.
       - 15 minutes past start time- Level 3 draft penalty.
       - 20 minutes past start time - Game 1 forfeit.
       - 30 minutes past start time - Game 2 forfeit.
     - If 30 minutes pass and neither team is capable of playing, a double forfeit is issued.
     - In order to be eligible for a forfeit win at the default time due to the other team not having 5 players in the lobby, the following additional conditions steps need to be taken:
       - A screenshot must be taken and posted publicly in the #captains channel, and a division admin should be @mentioned letting them know you want to claim a forfeit victory. Also, @mention the visiting captain again as a courtesy to let them know you are claiming a forfeit win.
       - It must be from within the RD2L Season X ticketed lobby in the Dota 2 game client in Steam.
       - Five players from the team's official roster must be seated on either the dire or radiant side. Please make your team name visible to make it easier for the admin to score the match.
       - The screenshot should have the Steam overlay (press ctrl+shift while in Dota) visible, which will show the system time is past the penalized time.
       - Once the screenshot is posted, no more needs to be done unless the other captain is there and disputes the situation. Or, the admin may say to hold on if he or she has already been in communication with the other captain about it. In this case, captains must work with the admin to try to resolve the situation and play the games. If that cannot happen, the division admin (or head admin in their stead) will making a ruling on the matter.
     - Each team is allowed 10 minutes of pause time per game.
       - Pauses are limited to 5 minutes in length for issues not related to a disconnected player. A team may pause two times in a game for issues not related to disconnection. There must be at least 5 minutes of game time passed between the these two pauses.
       - Each team can wait up to a total of 15 minutes per match for disconnected player(s).
       - In the event a player (or players) are unable to continue playing for any reason their team may choose to continue the match without them (using the DC’ed players heroes is permitted).
     - Teams have 15 minutes after the end of a game to create the lobby and start the subsequent game.
       - If one team needs more time, the other team needs to agree to the delay. Both captains must report agreement to delay the match to an admin for approval.
     - All chat is allowed, unless either team requests no all chat.
       - Tipping, Chat Wheel, and Hero Taunts are all allowed in official matches.
       - All chat is always allowed for purpose of calling GG.
       - All chat during games should be civil.
       - If a team repeatedly violates the no all chat request they may be forfeited by an admin.
       - Caster all chat is still strictly prohibited at all times!
     - Teams will coin flip for choice of side/pick, winner of the flip has first choice game 1 and loser has first choice game 2.
     - Captains are required to ticket all official matches. If matches cannot be ticketed due to an unforeseen issue, a screenshot of the score screen must be sent to an admin within 24 hours of the match.
     - Teams are not allowed to “stream cheat” in any way - no player currently in a game may view a stream of the game, spectate the game, or communicate with anyone doing so.
     - Team members not playing are permitted to be in a caster slot in the lobby if the opposing captain approves, but are not permitted to communicate with their team in any way while spectating. Coaches are not allowed in game.
     - Only recognized casters are permitted to be in broadcaster channels during matches.
       - Spectators on is encouraged but a 2 minute delay is required. No in-game spectators except admins and authorized casters are allowed in the lobby; they are only allowed to spectate in-client or a twitch stream.
     - Game remakes are permitted if there is a major issue affecting gameplay (major ping increases, heavy packet loss, Steam down). Both team captains must agree to remake.
     - Scripts and Macros are not allowed to be used by any RD2L player in official RD2L matches. Players found using these in official matches may have their team retroactively forfeited for the matches in question.
     - If a player selects the wrong hero in the pick phase of an official match, the team is allowed to have the match remade with the same hero picks for each team. This remake must be requested before the game loads in. Teams that have remakes often from this rule may have their ability to get lobbies remade revoked.
     - If a teams captain/drafter DC's during a draft, the team is allowed to pause. This pause will use the pause time a team is allotted during the game itself.
     - If a game breaking bug is found; admins reserve the right to put out in announcement banning a certain hero or certain usage of a hero if it would cause the game to break. If players or teams discover bugs of this nature they should inform an admin. Taking advantage of game breaking bugs may result in a forfeit loss.
   - **Regular Season**
     - The regular season is 8 weeks long, with a Captain’s Mode Bo2 each week.
     - Matches are to begin by their division’s scheduled match time each week on the designated server.
     - Matches may be rescheduled to a different time or day if both captains agree. (With a deadline of 24 hours after scheduled match time to ensure matchups will be out in a timely manner for the following week.)
     - Teams will be matched against other teams that have a similar record each week.
     - Match schedules will be posted as soon as all of the previous week’s results are checked (at least a few days before the match is to be played). This will allow teams time to prepare strategies and scout their opponents.
   - **Post Season**
     - After the regular season matches are completed, the top teams from each sub-division will be placed in an interdivisional single elimination playoff bracket for that region (NA or EU).
     - Teams will have one week to schedule and play their required matches. Each match must be scheduled and played by the end of the week for playoffs.
     - Each week a playoff thread will be put up where the captains of each team will be responsible for scheduling their match. You must agree with the other captain what day and time you will play the match. Both captains must post their agreement in the thread for the match to be officially scheduled, you may discuss the specifics in discord/steam if you wish and then just post the final result on the thread.
     - Teams will flip for side/pick/server (if teams have a primary server difference).
       - The team that won the flip will choose side or pick or server, the team that lost will choose from the remaining two, and then the team that won the flip will choose the final option. For game 2 the team that lost the flip game 1 will have first choice. If a series goes to game 3 a new flip will occur for the third game.
3. **Other**
   - **Communication**
     - Each RD2L player is encouraged to be on the RD2L main discord to keep up to date on league information, links to it can be found on our website and subreddit.
       - Keeping up with every channel is not required, but it is highly recommended that alerts are left on in the #announcements channel, and that the channel is checked at least once per week.
     - Players should check the subreddit at least once a week if possible for information being put out by the moderators or other participants.
   - **Conduct**
     - Flaming is part of Dota 2, but repeated conduct (in games, discord, subreddit, or anywhere) that violates the below standards may result in removal from the league:
       - No hate speech (speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender).
       - No cyber-bullying.
       - No tactical fake GG calls.
     - If a participant's behavior is deemed to be toxic, rude, interruptive to team play, or anything undesirable to the general well-being of most of the team, they may be removed by an admin. Depending on severity upon removal, they may be temporarily suspended.
       - If a player or captain is removed for poor conduct, the team is entitled to a free agent.
     - Players are expected to be available and present for all regular season and playoff matches, exceptions are acceptable but a commitment to the league and your team is agreed to upon signing up.
     - Players are expected to participate in any RD2L division they sign up for until the completion of the season. Quitting/Leaving any RD2L team may result in removal from other RD2L teams and bans from future seasons.

For any additional circumstances, if a majority of the admins approve, any action may be taken and will be accompanied by a post outlining the action and reasoning.
