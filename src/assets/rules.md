# RD2L Rules {title}

1. **Eligibility**
   - **Participants**
       - This is a player draft league. We only accept individual sign-ups, no team sign-ups.
       - All signups will be reviewed by a division admin.
       - Participants must sign up with their main account. This account may not be used by any other player for the duration of the season.
         - Participants are required to use the Steam account provided at the time of sign-ups when playing any RD2L game.
         - 500 games and 250 wins on the account must have been played on the account by the player who is signing up.
       - Participants must alert the admins if their rank does not accurately reflect their skill level, or if they have alternate accounts they regularly use.
         - Admins may adjust a participants rank to be more accurate in these situations.
       - Before registering, players are required to turn "Expose Public Match Data" on in the Dota 2 client > Settings > Options > Profile.
         - Players are not required to keep match data public for the remainder of the season, only for the draft.
       - No one should expect to miss more than 2 weeks in the season (including playoffs).
         - If a participant expects inconsistent attendance for an upcoming season, they are encouraged to instead sign up as a stand-in or free agent, as appropriate.
       - Admins will be watching for accounts that have unusual match history. Those accounts may be removed at the discretion of the admins. Since there are various ways this rule can be violated, any other punishment will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
       - Every player on a team’s roster must play each week if available, and each player on the roster must play one game for a minimum of five weeks over the course of the season.
         - This rule is extended into the post season. Every player on a team’s roster must play in each post season match if available
       - Participants may only play in 1 division in each season of RD2L.
   - **Captains**
     - Captains are also participants and all participant rules apply to captains.
     - Captains should have completed at least one previous season before signing up as a captain, unless they get permission from an admin.
     - Captains will be responsible for drafting and organizing their teams.
     - Captains will be responsible for reporting the results of each match immediately if the match is not ticketed.
     - Captains will be the primary contacts for their teams. This includes communication with other teams and RD2L admins.
     - Captains do not have the power to remove players from their teams after the draft.
     - Captains should be at least Legend[1] rank or higher. This threshold may be altered at the discretion of division admins.
   - **Stand-ins**
     - When a team is missing a player and requires a stand-in, they must formally request one in their divisions stand-in channel in discord, listing the dotabuff of their missing player and the dotabuff of the player they would like to use as a stand-in, they must @ their division admin and opposing captain for that week as well.
     - If a team is missing one of their players, the team is eligible to use a stand-in for this player.
       - The standin must have been the same mmr or lower on the draft sheet (according to adjusted mmr for players that were adjusted) and must not have climbed above the player they are replacing.
       - The standin must be a player signed up for the current season of RD2L.
       - Any standin may be used if both captains agree or via admin discretion.
     - Teams may use 2 stand-ins per match, for a maximum of 8 games during a season. Using two standins in one match counts as two standin uses. If a team finds itself needing more than this, they should contact a division admin with regards to a free agent.
       - Stand-in usage from the season will be reset for all playoff teams. Playoff teams may use a stand-in for a maximum of two series of the playoffs. (Series means all games of a round, usually best of 3 or best of 5)
       - If a team is forced to use a standin because admins have not found a free agent for the team yet, these standin uses will not count towards the team total.
     - If a team needs three stand-ins in order to play, they must forfeit the match.
     - If a captain believes a stand-in is not fair, they can report it to their division admin for a ruling.
     - If an admin discovers that a player used an unauthorized stand-in after the matches have been completed, the admin may retroactively award a forfeit for any games the unauthorized player played in.
   - **Free Agents**
     - Free agents are players that are eligible to be permanently added to teams during the season
     - If a captain would like a free agent, they must prove that they have an inactive player or a player disrupting team environment. After this is done, the player player in question is removed from the team in all forms.
     - Free agents may be assigned by the admins with the following priority (assuming mmr is similar to the player being replaced):
       - Players left over from the draft/signed up as free agents prior to the season.
       - Players from disbanded teams that were not the cause of the disband.
       - Players that signed up as free agents during the season.
     - When the admin assigns a new free-agent to the team, this free agent cannot be rejected.
     - The free agent will either be a close match or a player with lower rank (as close as possible), depending on the availability of free agents.
     - Free agents cannot be assigned until the end of scim week (Week 0) to ensure that teams are fully utilizing the players they drafted.
     - Free agents will not be assigned in the post season.
2. **Format**
   - **Divisions**
     - Divisions are determined every season by the RD2L admins.
     - Divisions will consist of a time zone and Dota 2 server combination (example: EST and USE) as well as a night of the week (example: Thursday). All matches for that division will be played on that server, on that night of the week, and the default times will be specific to that time zone.
     - Divisions will have as many teams as the number of captains assigned to that division and as few teams as the number of players signed up to fill out those teams. (Number of Players)/(5) ≤ (Number of Teams) ≤ (Number of Captains). Divisions will consist of at least 6 teams.
     - Each division will have its own admin. This admin will be the first point of contact for captains and players in the division. They will also be responsible for helping to run the draft, calling forfeits, approving stand-ins, assigning free agents, and checking results.
   - **Draft**
     - There will be 1 draft per division.
     - The player pool of the draft will consist of the first (4x total number of captains) players who registered for that division.
     - Players not making it into the draft pool will go into the free agent pool.
     - The draft format (e.g., snake, linear, etc.) will be determined by the division admins.
     - Pick order will be based on the captain’s mmr. (Roughly, captains lower badges will be earlier in the pick order.)
     - The draft will consist of 4 rounds, leaving each team with 5 members.
   - **Games**
     - All games are to be played on the division server and in Captains Mode, hosted by one of the captains or an admin on the RD2L ticket.
       - If a match does not begin before the default time and it is determined by an admin that it was due to no fault of the teams (e.g. Dota 2 network is down, there is a large Dota 2 update, etc.), then the admin may give the teams an extension.
     - Penalties for tardiness are as follows, and may be enforced by the opposing captain as they see fit:
       - 5 minutes past start time - Level 1 draft penalty.
       - 10 minutes past start time - Level 2 draft penalty.
       - 15 minutes past start time- Level 3 draft penalty.
       - 20 minutes past start time - Game 1 forfeit.
       - 30 minutes past start time - Game 2 forfeit.
     - If 30 minutes pass and neither team is capable of playing, a double forfeit is issued.
     - In order to be eligible for a forfeit win at the default time due to the other team not having 5 players in the lobby, the following additional conditions steps need to be taken:
       - A screenshot must be posted publicly in the #captains channel with an @mention to the division admin and opposing captain.
       - It must be from within the RD2L Season X ticketed lobby in the Dota 2 game client in Steam.
       - Five players from the team's official roster must be seated on either the dire or radiant side with the team name visible.
       - The screenshot should have the Steam overlay (press ctrl+shift while in Dota) visible, showing the system time.
       - If there is a dispute, captains must work with the admin to try to resolve the situation and play the games. If unresolved, the division admin (or head admin in their stead) will making a ruling on the matter.
     - Each team is allowed 10 minutes of pause time per game.
       - Pauses are limited to 5 minutes in length for issues not related to a disconnected player. A team may pause two times in a game for issues not related to disconnection. There must be at least 5 minutes of game time passed between the these two pauses.
       - Each team can wait up to a total of 15 minutes per match for disconnected player(s).
       - In the event a player is unable to continue playing, their team may choose to continue the match without them (using the DC’ed players heroes is permitted).
     - Teams have 15 minutes after the end of a game to create the lobby and start the subsequent game.
       - Both captains must report agreement to delay the match to an admin for approval.
     - All chat is allowed, unless either team requests no all chat.
       - Tipping, Chat Wheel, and Hero Taunts are all allowed in official matches, but not battle pass items because this league is srs bzns.
       - All chat is always allowed for purpose of calling GG.
       - All chat during games should be civil.
       - If a team repeatedly violates the no all chat request, they may be forfeited by an admin.
       - Caster all chat is still strictly prohibited at all times.
     - Teams will coin flip for choice of side/pick; winner of the flip has first choice game 1 and loser has first choice game 2.
     - Teams are not allowed to “stream cheat” in any way - no player currently in a game may view a stream of the game, spectate the game, or communicate with anyone doing so.
     - Team members not playing are permitted to be in a caster slot in the lobby if the opposing captain approves, but are not permitted to communicate with their team in any way while spectating. Coaches are not allowed in game.
     - Only recognized casters are permitted to be in broadcaster channels during matches.
       - Spectators on is encouraged but a 2 minute delay is required.
     - Game remakes are permitted if there is a major issue affecting gameplay (major ping increases, heavy packet loss, Steam down). Both team captains must agree to remake.
     - Scripts and Macros are not allowed to be used by any RD2L player in official RD2L matches. Players found using these in official matches may have their team retroactively forfeited for the matches in question.
     - If a player selects the wrong hero in the pick phase of an official match, the team is allowed to have the match remade with the same hero picks for each team. This remake must be requested in the first 20 seconds of the match.
     - If a teams captain/drafter DC's during a draft, the team is allowed to pause. This pause will use the pause time a team is allotted during the game itself.
     - Taking advantage of game breaking bugs may result in a forfeit loss.
   - **Regular Season**
     - The regular season is 8 weeks long, with a Captain’s Mode Bo2 each week.
     - Matches are to begin by their division’s scheduled match time each week on the designated server.
     - Matches may be rescheduled to a different time or day if both captains agree, with a deadline of 24 hours after scheduled match time to ensure matchups will be out in a timely manner for the following week.
     - Teams will be matched against other teams that have a similar record each week.
     - Match schedules will be posted as soon as all of the previous week’s results are checked (at least a few days before the match is to be played).

     - After the regular season matches are completed, the top teams from each sub-division will be placed in an interdivisional single elimination playoff bracket.
     - Teams will have one week to schedule and play their required matches. Each match must be scheduled and played by the end of the week for playoffs.
     - Teams will flip for side/pick/server (if teams have a primary server difference).
       - The team that won the flip will choose side or pick or server, the team that lost will choose from the remaining two, and then the team that won the flip will choose the final option. For game 2 the team that lost the flip game 1 will have first choice. If a series goes to game 3, a new flip will occur for the third game.
